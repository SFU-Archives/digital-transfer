# Digital Transfer
This site provides documentation for digital transfers to SFU Archives. Documentation is maintained in the [Wiki section of this site](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-transfer/wiki). Procedures are mainly from the point of view of Archives staff who manage the transfer process. Guidelines, documentation and training materials for producers (SFU staff and private donors) will be developed separately and published on the Archives' website.

BagIt profiles for use with [DART](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/wiki/DART), the Archives' preferred packaging tool, are published on the [Digital Repository Utilities](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/tree/master/bagit-profiles) section of the Archives' GitHub site.

## Recent changes and additions
Transfer procedures originally developed in 2020-21 (PRC-057 v4.2) have been retired ([pdf version available here](/downloads/DigitalTransferProcedures_v4-2.zip)). These were based on the use of [SFU MoveIt](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/wiki/SFU-MoveIt) as the Archives' preferred packaging tool. In the fall of 2023 the Archives retired the MoveIt app and began investigating [DART](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/wiki/DART) as a replacement packager. The Archives has now begun a review and update of the transfer procedures themselves, and all transfer documentation has been moved to the [Wiki section](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-transfer/wiki) of this GitHub repo.
