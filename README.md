# Digital Transfer
This site provides documentation for digital transfers to SFU Archives. Documentation is maintained in the [Wiki](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-transfer/wiki). Procedures are mainly from the point of view of Archives staff who manage the transfer process. Guidelines, documentation and training materials for producers wishing to transfer materials will be developed and published on the Archives' website.

BagIt profiles for use with [DART](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/wiki/DART), the Archives' preferred packaging tool, are published on the [Digital Repository Utilities](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/tree/master/bagit-profiles) section of the Archives' GitHub site.

## Recent changes and additions
### January 2024
Transfer procedures originally developed in 2020-21 (PRC-057 v4.2) have been retired ([pdf version available here](/downloads/DigitalTransferProcedures_v4-2.zip). These were based on [SFU MoveIt](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/wiki/SFU-MoveIt) as the Archives' preferred packaging tool. In the fall of 2023 the Archives retired the MoveIt app, began investigating [DART](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/wiki/DART) as a replacement packager, and has now begun a review and update of the transfer procedures themselves. All transfer documentation has been moved to the [Wiki section](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-transfer/wiki) of this GitHub repo.
