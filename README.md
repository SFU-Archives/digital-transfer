# Digital Transfer
###### Status: under development
This site provides documentation relating to the transfer of digital materials to SFU Archives. It is a work in progress and will be updated as new sections are added.

**Contents**
- [Transfer scenarios](transfer-scenarios.md)

- [Standard transfer method: procedures for departmental staff and donors](procedures/standard-producers/01-introduction.md)

- [Standard transfer method: procedures for Archives](procedures/standard-archives/01-introduction.md)

The [transfer scenarios page](transfer-scenarios.md) identifies various possible scenarios and the transfer methods appropriate to them.

The Archives' standard transfer method uses SFU MoveIt (for packaging) and SFU Vault (for deposit). Procedures are described separately for producers sending the materials (i.e. [SFU departmental staff and private donors](procedures/standard-producers/01-introduction.md)) and for [Archives staff]((procedures/standard-archives/01-introduction.md)) receiving the materials. For email transfers, see the separate [email archiving guidelines](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/email-archiving) on this GitHub site.
