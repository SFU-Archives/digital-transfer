# Digital Transfer
###### Status: under development
This site provides documentation relating to the transfer of digital materials to SFU Archives. It is a work in progress and will be updated as new sections are added.

**Contents**
- [Transfer scenarios](transfer-scenarios.md)

- [Standard transfer method: procedures for departmental staff and donors](procedures/standard-producers/01-introduction.md)

- [Standard transfer method: procedures for Archives](procedures/standard-archives/01-introduction.md)

The [transfer scenarios page](transfer-scenarios.md) identifies various possible scenarios and the transfer methods appropriate to them.

The Archives' **standard transfer method** uses SFU MoveIt (for packaging) and SFU Vault (for deposit). [The workflow diagram can be downloaded here](../../downloads/DigitalTransferWorkflow.pdf) (pdf). There are separate procedures for producers who sending the materials (i.e. [SFU departmental staff and private donors](procedures/standard-producers/01-introduction.md)); and for [Archives staff]((procedures/standard-archives/01-introduction.md)) who are receiving them. For email transfers, see the separate [email archiving guidelines](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/email-archiving) elsewhere on this GitHub site.
