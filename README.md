# Digital Transfer
This site provides documentation for digital transfers to SFU Archives. Documentation is maintained in the [Wiki](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-transfer/wiki). Procedures are mainly from the point of view of Archives staff who manage the transfer process. Guidelines, documentation and training materials for producers wishing to transfer materials will be developed and published on the Archives' website.
