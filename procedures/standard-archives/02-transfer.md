# 2. Transfer
<img align="right" width="350" src="../../screenshots/02-transfer.png">

The main activities in the **transfer** phase belong to the producer, who packages the files using SFU MoveIt and uploads the transfer package to the deposit folder you created previously in [step 1.2](01-pre-transfer.md#12-create-a-deposit-folder). For a description of these activities from the producer's point of view, see [Standard Transfer Method: Procedures for SFU Staff and Private Donors, section 2. Transfer](../standard-producers/02-transfer.md).

## Steps
- [2.1 Receive notice of a deposit](#21-receive-notice-of-a-deposit)
- [2.2 Create an Accession record](#22-create-an-accession-record)
- [2.3 Download the transfer package](#23-download-the-transfer-package)

## 2.1 Receive notice of a deposit
Deposit folders on SFU Vault account are configured to send activity notification emails to the `moveit` email account.
- The `moveit` account will receive an email when a producer uploads a transfer package to a deposit folder.
- The time lag between upload and email notice can be several hours.

Email notices go only to the generic `moveit` account. For individual staff to receive them, there are three options:
1. Sign in and monitor the `moveit` email account regularly (e.g. at the beginning of the day).
1. Add a share from the `moveit` account to your own email address and view the shared folders in your own account.
1. Create a redirect rule in the `moveit` account to forward a copy of all messages received by `moveit` to your own account.

For instructions, see SFU Mail documentation on [adding shares](https://www.sfu.ca/sfumail/using-sfu-mail/sharing/sharing-mail-folders.html) and [creating redirect rules](https://www.sfu.ca/sfumail/using-sfu-mail/mail/managing-mail/forward-mail-to-another-account.html).

## 2.2 Create an Accession record
<img align="right" width="400" src="../../screenshots/02-create-accession.png">

Generate an AIS `Accession number` for the transfer.
- Each deposit should be registered as a separate accession.
- Even if the transfer is eventually rejected during [validation](03-validation.md), the Accession record provides a place to document the decision.

To generate a new Accession number:
- Open the AIS `Archives module`.
- Go to the `Home` > `Accessions` > `Actions` tab.
- Click the `Get new accession number` link.
- The AIS creates a new accession, assigns it the next available number, gives it the provisional title "SFU MoveIt transfer", and copies the accession number to your clipboard.

Make a note of the Accession number, as you will need it later during [step 3, Validation](03-validation.md).

## 2.3 Download the transfer package
Download a copy of the transfer package from SFU Vault to your desktop for validation and analysis.
- It is possible to open and inspect the contents on SFU Vault, but the various software tools used in the [Validation phase](03-validation.md) cannot be run on the deposit Vault space.
