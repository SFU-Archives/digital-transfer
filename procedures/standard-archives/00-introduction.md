# Standard Transfer Method: Procedures for Archives
###### Status: under development
The standard digital transfer method involves the use of SFU MoveIt to create transfer packages; SFU Vault for deposit; SFU ProveIt for validation; the AIS database for accessioning; and Archivematica for ingest.

These procedures describe the process from the point of view of Archives' staff. In the workflow diagram below, actions and decision points by Archives are shaded blue.
