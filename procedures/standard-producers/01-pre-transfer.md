Before you make your first transfer, contact the Archives to [request a deposit folder on SFU Vault](#11-request-access-to-a-deposit-folder). You will also need to [download SFU MoveIt](#12-download-sfu-moveit), the Archives' digital packaging tool. If you will be making regular digital transfers, consider requesting a [Digital Transfer Account](#13-request-an-onging-digital-transfer-account) as this will provide you with continuing access to a deposit folder.

## 1.1 Request a deposit folder
The Archives manages transfer deposit folders on its SFU Vault space. To request a deposit folder, contact the Archives directly (tel. 2-2380 or email archives@sfu.ca or moveit@sfu.ca).

Note that the Archives tries to limit the number of transfer contacts per department or organization in order to centralize the transfer process for a given unit.
- This is to avoid duplication of effort, reduce the likelihood that the same materials will be sent by different people, and facilitate communications relating to transfers, holdings, retrievals, and changes to tools and processes.

On approval, the Archives creates the deposit folder and sends you a confirmation email with the folder name and a link.
- Folder names typically following a standard naming convention: `Deposit_<<OrgDeptName>>`.

## 1.2 Download SFU MoveIt
<img align="right" width="400" src="../../screenshots/01-download-moveit.png">

SFU MoveIt is a small, open-source desktop utility for packaging files in standardized containers ("bags") that follow the [BagIt File Packaging Format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493). It was developed by Alex Garnett, SFU Research Data Management & Systems Librarian.
- For more information about the app, see the [SFU MoveIt page](https://www.sfu.ca/archives/digital-preservation/sfu-moveit.html) on the [Archives' website](https://www.sfu.ca/archives).

### Download
To download the app, go to the developer's [GitHub download page for the latest release](https://github.com/axfelix/moveit-electron/releases/tag/2.0.6) (version 2.0.6).
- Select the version for your operating system: Mac = `dmg` file, Windows = `exe` file.
- When download is complete, double-click the `dmg` or `exe` file and move the application icon to a location on your computer.
- The app can be stored and run from any location on your machine, but Archives recommends storing it in your standard `Applications` folder (Mac) or `Programs` folder (Windows).

### Security warnings
Note that you may get security warnings when you first open the app.
- The Mac version is an Apple "signed" or certified app, but the first time you open it you may be prompted to confirm permissions to run the software.
- With the Windows version, you may have to click through several security warnings to open the application the first time.

### Uninstall
To uninstall SFU MoveIt, simply drag the application icon to the trash/recycle bin.

## 1.3 Request an ongoing Digital Transfer Account
<img align="right" width="400" src="../../screenshots/01-account-request-form.png">

With a one-off transfer, your access to the deposit folder is temporary and expires on completion of the transfer. If you will be regularly sending digital records to Archives, you should request an ongoing **Digital Transfer Account**. This provides you with continuing access to a deposit folder.

Request an account by contacting the Archives directly or by completing and submitting the [online request form](https://www.sfu.ca/archives/digital-preservation/digital-transfer-account.html) on the Archives' website
- On approval, you will no longer be required to contact the Archives in advance of a transfer, you simply access the deposit folder as needed.

If you have an SFU email address, the Archives can set up a share for you on the deposit folder.
- With a share, you can install the SFU Vault desktop application on your computer so that the shared deposit folder (typically named `Deposit_<DeptOrgName>`) will appear as a folder in your local file system and syncs with the remote folder on Vault.
- For more information on SFU Vault, see the [help and information pages](https://www.sfu.ca/itservices/collaboration/sfu-vault.html) maintained by SFU ITS.
