# Standard Transfer: Procedures for Producers
###### Status: under development
These procedures are written for SFU staff and private donors ("producers") who wish to transfer their digital records to the Archives. In the workflow diagram below, actions and decision points by producers are shaded green.

For the same process from the Archives point of view, see [Standard Transfer Method: Procedures for Archives](../standard-archives/00-introduction.md).
