# 4. Completion
<img align="right" width="350" src="../../screenshots/05-completion.png">

**Completion** is triggered when you receive a **Transfer Completed Notice** from the Archives. This signals that the Archives has accessioned the records into its preservation system and assumed custody and control over them. [Retain the Notice](#41-receive-completion-notice) for your own files and, if appropriate, [delete the records](#42-delete-transferred-records) you transferred from your active system. For more information about what happens to the records post-transfer, see [Appendix C](../appendices/c-post-transfer.md); this include a section about how to make [retrieval requests](../appendices/c-post-transfer.md#retrieval-requests).

## Steps
- [4.1 Receive completion notice](#41-receive-completion-notice)
- [4.2 Delete transferred records](#42-delete-transferred-records)

## 4.1 Receive completion notice

The Archives will notify you by email when it has completed [validation and ingest](03-validation-ingest.md) of your transfer.
- The email includes a formal **Transfer Completed Notice** (pdf) as an attachment.
- The Notice includes a list of all files included in the transfer.
- Retain the Notice for your records: you will need to refer to it later if you request a file retrieval (see [Appendix C](../appendices/c-post-transfer.md#retrieval-requests))

## 4.2 Delete transferred records
The records have now passed into the custody and control of the Archives and can be deleted from your active system. The materials you should delete include:
- The **Transfer folder(s)** you created in [step 2.2](02-transfer.md#22-create-transfer-folders)
- The **Transfer package(s)** created with SFU MoveIt in [step 2.3](02-transfer.md#23-create-a-transfer-package-with-sfu-moveit).

For **university departments** deletion ensures that:
- You will not unintentionally re-transfer the same records at a later date.
- You are in compliance with the applicable records retention schedule.
- You minimize the risk of unauthorized access, use or disclosure of any personal or confidential information contained in the records.

**Private donors** should discuss with an archivist the expectations for donor copies of transferred materials.
- In some cases donors and the Archives may agree that the donor will retain their own copies of digital records transferred to Archives.
- Decisions should be set out in the **Donation Agreement**, but as this is relatively new practice by the Archives older agreements will not explicitly include this.
- If in doubt, contact the Archives to discuss.
