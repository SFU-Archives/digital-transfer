### January 2024
Transfer procedures originally developed in 2020-21 (PRC-057 v4.2) have been retired ([pdf version available here](/downloads/DigitalTransferProcedures_v4-2.zip)). These were based on the use of [SFU MoveIt](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/wiki/SFU-MoveIt) as the Archives' preferred packaging tool. In the fall of 2023 the Archives retired the MoveIt app and began investigating [DART](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-repository-utilities/wiki/DART) as a replacement packager. The Archives has now begun a review and update of the transfer procedures themselves, and all transfer documentation has been moved to the [Wiki section](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/digital-transfer/wiki) of this GitHub repo.
