# Why Might the Archives Reject My Request to Transfer Digital Records?
The Archives typically accepts requests to transfer, but there may be circumstances in which it rejects a request.

### Not a designated transfer contact
The Archives tries to limit the number of transfer contacts per university department or donor organization in order to centralize the transfer process for a given unit. This is to:
- Avoid duplication of effort.
- Reduce the likelihood that the same materials will be sent by different people.
- Facilitate communications relating to transfers, holdings, retrievals, and changes to tools and processes.

If your unit already has a designated contact, the Archives may request that you work with that person to transfer the records.

### Records were already previously transferred
It is inevitable that over time some duplicate documents will be sent to Archives in different transfers, as the same document may be used in different contexts and filed in different folders accordingly. This is totally fine.

The type of duplication the Archives does **not** want is repeated transfers of essentially the same block of records – e.g. resending a set of committee records that were sent the previous year.

### Records not archival
University records should only be transferred under a Records Retention Schedule and Disposal Authority (RRSDA) that designates the records as **archival**. The Archives will not accept transfers of records scheduled for **destruction** or (typically) records that have not yet been scheduled (though some exceptions here may apply).

### Records not yet due for transfer
RRSDAs establish a time-table for how long departments should retain records before transfer to Archives. The Archives may reject your request if the records are not yet **due for disposal**.

It is fairly common, however, for departments to wish to transfer digital records to the Archives before the total retention period as set out in the RRSDA has expired. Often the applicable RRSDA was originally designed for paper records, with provision for off-site storage in the University Records Centre during the semi-active period. **There is currently no equivalent semi-active off-site storage for electronic records. All digital transfers are "archival", i.e. the records pass to the control of the Archives.**

Early transfer is often acceptable, but you should be aware that records will no longer "belong to" the department and will now come under the custody and control of the Archives. Do not send these records if you still need to frequently consult them.

### Records not covered by a Donation Agreement
Private records – i.e. personal archives or records of non-SFU organizations – can only be transferred under a signed Donation Agreement. If such an agreement is not in place (or under negotiation), the Archives will likely reject request pending further appraisal and acquisition decision.

It is, however, common and acceptable for donors to send materials before the Donation Agreement has been finalized (e.g. so an archivist can better assess the proposed donation).
