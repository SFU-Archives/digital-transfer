# What is SFU MoveIt?
**SFU MoveIt** is a small Python-based desktop utility for packaging digital records for transfer to the Archives. The application was developed by Alex Garnett, SFU Research Data Management & Systems Librarian. The latest version (2.0.6) was released in December 2020.

SFU MoveIt follows the [BagIt File Packaging Format](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8493) to create **transfer packages** on a user's local machine as standard BagIt containers ([Bags](faq5-bag.md)). The app provides an interface for users to enter transfer metadata (contact information, records description) which is written to the Bag. The transfer is then ready for upload to a designated deposit folder on [SFU Vault](faq2-sfu-vault.md), the university's file-sharing and storage service.
