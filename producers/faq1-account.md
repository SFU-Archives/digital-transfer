# What is a Digital Transfer Account and Who Should Get One?
A **Digital transfer account** gives you on-going access to a transfer **deposit folder** on SFU Vault. Having an account means that you do not have to request prior approval for a transfer, you simply upload your transfers as required.

### Who is eligible?
You must have an SFU email account to be eligible for a Digital transfer account. Donors of non-university records who do not have an SFU email address cannot get a transfer account.

### How does it work?
The Archives will set up a **share** for you on the deposit folder. With a share, you can install the [SFU Vault desktop application](http://www.sfu.ca/download-sfuvault/) on your local computer so that the shared deposit folder (typically named `Deposit_<<DeptOrgName>>`) will appear as a directory in your local file system and syncs with the remote folder on Vault.

For more information on SFU Vault, see the [help and information pages](https://www.sfu.ca/information-systems/services/sfu-vault.html) maintained by SFU ITS.

### Who should get an account?
If you are just making an occasional or one-off transfer, you do not need an account. You will have temporary access to a deposit folder, with sufficient time to complete the transfer project as needed.

If you are your department's designated transfer contact and will be regularly transferring digital records in the future, you should have an account as this will simplify future transfers.

### How do I request an account?
Contact the Archives' general reference desk (archives-at-sfu.ca) or Shamin Malmas, SFU's Records Management Archivst (shamin_malmas-at-sfu.ca).
