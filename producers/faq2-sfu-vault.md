# What is SFU Vault
**SFU Vault** is the university's internal cloud storage and file sharing service. You can read more about [SFU Vault here](https://www.sfu.ca/information-systems/services/sfu-vault.html).

The Archives uses SFU Vault to host **deposit folders** for SFU departments and private donors. The folders are typically named `Deposit_<<OrganizationName>>`. For users with an on-going [Digital transfer account](faq1-account.md), if they install the desktop version of Vault their deposit folder will appear in their file directory in Windows Explorer or Mac's Finder.
